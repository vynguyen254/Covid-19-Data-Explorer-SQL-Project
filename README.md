# Covid-19 by Population
This repository contains all queries and visualization related to data exploration of COVID-19 using SQL(SSMS) and Tableau. In this project, I wanted to look at the impact of COVID-19 on regions across the world. I utilized SQL to extract, transform, and filter data by using aggregating and filtering functions. Finally, I loaded and visualized data in tables, bar charts, line charts, and maps.

The table shows the Death rate of COVID-19 globally from 2020 to 2023.

The line charts show the percentage of the infected population in selected countries over 3 years and forecast the trends in 2024.
